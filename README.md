This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the AI in Industry course. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of key concepts and technologies used in modern AI and industrial applications. Below is a brief overview of the projects included:

Projects Overview:

a) Exclusive Pair Model (Assign-4)

b) Implementation of the exclusive pair model, showcasing coordination and synchronization in distributed systems.
c) Line Detection with OpenCV.
d) A Python-based project using OpenCV to detect and visualize lines in images, demonstrating computer vision techniques.
e) Paho-MQTT (Assign-5).
f) Implementation of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for lightweight messaging in IoT systems using the Paho library.
g) PostgreSQL (Assign-6).
h) Database management and querying using PostgreSQL, highlighting data storage and retrieval in industrial applications.
i) Publisher-Subscriber Model (Assign-2).
j) A messaging pattern implementation where publishers send messages to subscribers, simulating real-time communication systems.
k) Push-Pull Model (Assign-3).
l) Demonstration of the push-pull messaging pattern for task distribution and load balancing in distributed systems.
m) Request-Response Model (Assign-1).
n) A classic client-server interaction model showcasing request-response communication in networked systems.
o) Patient Scheduling (Patient_Scheduling.py).
f) A Python implementation of various scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin) for optimizing patient treatment workflows.

Skills Demonstrated:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, Paho-MQTT, PostgreSQL
Concepts: Distributed Systems, Messaging Patterns, Scheduling Algorithms, Computer Vision, Database Management

This repository showcases my ability to apply AI and industrial concepts to solve real-world problems. Each project reflects my understanding of key technologies and my hands-on experience in implementing them. Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities!

Setup:
Steps to run my programs - You have to setup AmazonEC-2 instance on AWS platform and then launch jupyterlab -
here are the resources to setup your instance:
1) https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/jupyterlab-on-aws-ec2-d6b2cb945e54 (windows)
2) For mac users - https://youtu.be/tHpH3Uh-H5Y?si=UFxUiyEHouQSPtT3
3) you can run only on jupyterlab also if you dont want EC-2 - https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/set-up-jupyter-notebook-on-aws-ec2-instance-1a87d1707467
4) https://youtu.be/PVXVGAX_QNM?si=Z2CVS2ouOWVq9OOy (windows)
5)  Anaconda users - https://dataschool.com/data-modeling-101/running-jupyter-notebook-on-an-ec2-server/
